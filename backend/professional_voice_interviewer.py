Professional AI Voice Interviewer - Formal Technical Interview System

This module implements a sophisticated voice-based interview system that combines:
- ElevenLabs Conversational AI for natural voice interactions
- Real-time IDE monitoring and code analysis
- Mathematics.py scoring system for objective evaluation
- Dual mode support: Chat (Gemini) and Voice (ElevenLabs)
- Professional formal interview protocols

The system is designed to conduct formal, professional technical interviews
while providing real-time guidance and evaluation based on candidate performance.
